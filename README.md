# Setup Machine Learning on Apple Silicon M1

This is simple a setup instruction for machine learning required packages, Python and TensorFlow on Apple Metal M1.

Apple Silicon M1 is truly a powerfull SoC and yet it is exsiting to try some casual ML models using the neural engine in this chip. While most of the CUDA packages architecture is different than the M1, installing ML packages could be pain in the bottom!

This instruction aims to simply and craft an step by step guide to setup using MiniForge.

P.S. Pytorch is currently struggling to catch up with M1 and there is no straight solution to using accelerated GPU with Pytorn, feel free to pull this repo and add any other update/solution you might have.
